# WeatherCheck
This is a repository for my first project completed within Python, a simple Weather Check program completed within Python.

## Process

To Function the code, you just need to run the program, enter a zip code or city name, and the program will showcase the current temperature. type "quit" to end.

## Importance of Information

Although this is a simple program and shows information for a user-input zip or city, I felt this was important to keep apart of my resume to just show how far I have came from originally starting my coding journey. Seeing where I came from originally, starting with a basic weather program, to current day, where I have created NBA Similarity Scores, CFB Attendance EDA, and other programs I now have put a lot of time and effort into, it is a great starting point to see how far along my journey has been. This code was created in March of 2024, and within a year, I have been able to exceed my own wildest dreams when coding, and continue to expand and look forward to the future.
